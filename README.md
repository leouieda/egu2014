# Gravity inversion in spherical coordinates using tesseroids

**Leonardo Uieda and ValÃ©ria C. F. Barbosa**


satellite gravity => dense coverage over vast areas

enables regional/global interpretation

like large igneous provinces, suture zones, moho, intracratonic basins

requires using spherical coordinates

a lot of progress in forward modeling in spherical coordinates using tesseroids

particularly into making modeling fast and accurate

however, space domain inverse modeling techniques have not yet been adapted to
use tesseroids

There are a vast range of methods developed for rectangular prisms

methods for estimating the relief of an interface, like the Moho or basement of
a sedimentary basement.

A variety of algorithms to estimate the density distribution in a medium.

Ranging from analytic solutions to random search methods and systematic search.

A range of regularizations: smooth, total variation, compactness

We present an adaptation of the systematic search method of "planting anomalous
densities" for tesseroids.
